# tabswitch

A simple Chrome extension to switch between the two most recently used tabs,
with minimal permissions required. There are other extensions with similar
functionality, but they often require excessive permissions.

## Installation

You can install this by visiting [Switch Tabs in the Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/switch-tabs/jpfcacngcfejgnoaobkgoojockhdlphi).

## Permissions

The extension requires Storage permissions to persist the last used tabs across
browser restarts.

## Configuration

By default, you can toggle between the two most recently used tabs using
`Ctrl-Q` (on Mac, Windows, and Linux alike). You can choose a different
keybinding via `More Tools -> Extensions -> (Hotdog Menu) Keybindings`.
